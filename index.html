        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Calatayud was founded by the Romans as Augusta Bilbilis, and its ruins, including a Roman theater and mosaics, can still be visited nearby.

            Augusta Bilbilis was a city founded by the Romans in the province of Hispania Tarraconensis. It was the birthplace of famous poet Martial c.40 AD.
            Coins were also minted in the city with "Augusta Bilbilis" on the reverse along with the governor's name.

            The modern city grew around a Moorish castle during the Islamic period, and the name “Calatayud” comes from the Arabic Qalʿat Ayyūb,
            meaning “Ayyub's castle.” Historically, Calatayud has been an important crossroads between Madrid and Zaragoza. Today, it is also connected 
            via the high-speed AVE train, making it accessible for travelers.</p>
